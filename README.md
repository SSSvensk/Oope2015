Protoplasm simulator

Life is getting started on this strange planet, where signs of life appear only in protoplasm where there's this organism called "Lötkö". Lötkös have always location, size and DNA. And they seem to be immortal! Now there's two types of *Lötkös*: Klimppi and Pläntti. Klimppis have color which is either red or blue. Plänttis are known for their shape: they're either oval, or not. As IRL, it's essential to produce offspring, so Lötkös has figured out the way how to do that. Klimppis breed in pairs. Klimmpis need to be in same location and they need to have same color. After that they give birth to new Klimppi, which has different color than its parents and its DNA is 50:50. New Pläntti requires only one parent. Biggest Pläntti in location gives birth to new Pläntti, which has same form than its parent, its DNA is the same as its parents DNA backwards and the size is half of its parents size.

After this short introduction, how does this program works...
There's commands for different actions. Commands are in Finnish, but here they're also in English.
* Lataa/Load (Load data from .txt-file)
* Listaa/List (List all the Lötkös)
* Listaa/List n, where n is index value of some Lötkö (List similiar Lötkös as Lötkö with index value n)
* Listaa/List x y, where x and y are coordinates (List all Lötkös in given location)
* Liiku/Move (Moves every Lötkö to random direction)
* Liiku/Move n x y, where n == index, x and y coordinates (Moves Lötkö with index n to location (x,y))
* Luo/Create (Creates new Lötkös)
* Tallenna/Save (Save list of Lötkös to .txt-file)
* Lopeta/Quit (Quit the game)

WETO is still causing me nightmares:(
